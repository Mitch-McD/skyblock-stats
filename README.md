# skyblock-stats
A small personal website project mainly to re-learn HTML, JS, and CSS. Reads in APIs from the Hypixel Skyblock Minecraft server about a given player name's stats and displays them.

# Why does this exist?
The original purposes of this project were both to act as a refresher on web development basics and to provide something of a launching ground for an online portfolio. 

# How do I run it?
This project is (so far) a locally-ran collection of .HTML, .js, and .css files. To use, simply download the files and run them from your machine. This project may become hosted at some point. 

You may also need a Hypixel developer API key in order for some of the API get()s to work in this project, it can be obtained from: https://developer.hypixel.net/
